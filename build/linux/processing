# This script runs Processing, using the JRE in the Processing 
# installation directory.

# If your system needs a different version of Java than what's included
# in the download, replace the 'java' folder with the contents of a new
# Oracle JRE (Java 8 only), or create a symlink named "java" in the 
# Processing installation directory that points to the JRE home directory.
# This must be a Sun/Oracle JDK. For more details, see here:
# https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Supported-Platforms

# Thanks to Ferdinand Kasper for this build script. [fry]
